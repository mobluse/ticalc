1. System and Memory Requirements
This program is for the TI-82. It consists of two main programs,
and one sub program that together uses 219 bytes. It requires
additionally a minimum of 108 bytes, and a maximum of 973 bytes for
data to run, depending on the number of numbers :-).

GCDHCF and LCMLCD uses or alters these variables:
Real:   J,K,L,M,N
List:   L1


2. Installation
If you have TI-GRAPH LINK UUDecode this file, and send the resulting
GCDLCM.82G program to the calculator. If you don't have a link you
will have to enter the three ASCII82P listings below.


3. User Instructions
The program computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) or the Highest 
Common Factor (HCF) of some numbers. The GCD is defined as the 
largest number which divides all the given numbers evenly (i.e. 
with remainder zero). This is same as the HCF.

GCDHCF handles lists as long as the TI-82 allows i.e. 99 elements.
The elements must be integers greater than or equal to zero.
The program uses the list stored in Ans.

Example:
{20,70,80}:prgmGCDHCF [ENTER]
Ans=10

Example:
{294,210,126,462} [ENTER]
prgmGCDHCF [ENTER]
Ans=42
Which can be tested by:
{294,210,126,462}/42 [ENTER]
Ans={7 5 3 11}

A common manual algorithm is to divide all numbers with a small
prime number, that divide all the numbers evenly. Write out the
results and then 'Da Capo al Fine'. Then one multiplies together
the divisors [factors] to get the GCD [HCF]. However this is not 
the algorithm this program uses.

LCMLCD has the same user interface as GCDHCF but computes the
Least Common Multiple or the Least Common Denominator. The LCM is
defined as least number that is a multiple of each number in the
list. A multiple of a number is the product of that number and
an integer. The LCD is same as the LCM.

Example:
{21,24,26,28}:prgmLCMLCD [ENTER]
Ans=2184

Warning:
This program is not secure. You can enter erroneous indata 
without the program complaining, and you may receive reasonable 
but incorrect outdata. (This is famous SISO priniple, Shit In
Shit Out.) But it is not difficult to add code to make it safe.


4. Program Comments
The program uses Euclid's GCD [HCF] algorithm. GCDHCF and LCMLCD
uses the same subprogram: ZGCDHCF. 'MfPart (N/M)' computes the 
remainder of N integer-divided by M. The 'round(' function prevents
build-up of floating point errors.
